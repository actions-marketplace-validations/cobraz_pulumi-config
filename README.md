  <strong>Update Pulumi configuration with Github Actions</strong>
</p>

\
This [Github Actions][] uses [Pulumi Automation API][] to update your
stack configuration. Useful when you need to automate changes!

**Warning**: No release yet! We are actively doing development, so expect
things to fail. Development is done publicly on Github, so help is very much
appreciated!
